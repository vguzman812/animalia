        text: "Acorn woodpeckers are so good at snugly fitting acorns into holes they make in trees that they often have trouble pulling them out. In fact, whenever the woodpecker finds a loose acorn in a hole, it will put the acorn into a tighter fitting hole. It's all about keeping critters from stealing them.",

And, when they’re defending themselves, they yell at would-be attackers. A defensive penguin will also bend down low, point its sharp beak at the would-be attacker, and feign fierce pecking.",

They have a hunting success rate of 60-90%, making them more consistently successful than Lions or Hyenas. (Photo Credit: Mark Nicholson - Instagram)",

        text: "Despite its name, this breed is not associated with the Inuit at all. Instead, it was bred from the German Spitz in the 19th century by immigrants who settled in the Midwest. Although originally developed as a farm dog, this breed became a popular performer at circuses and roadshows. After the United States entered World War I, the name was changed to the American Eskimo as a result of high anti-German sentiment running through the country.",

The males use these sounds to attract the female toads for breeding. During the mating season, these calls become louder, constant, and more frantic. When these calls are made, the throats of the male toads puff out like balloons. However, this is not the only way that the American toads communicate.
